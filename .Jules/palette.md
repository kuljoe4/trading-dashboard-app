## 2025-05-16 - Accessible Interactive Headers and Utility Buttons
**Learning:** Interactive accordion headers implemented as `div`s require explicit ARIA roles, tab indexing, and keyboard event handlers (Enter/Space) to be accessible. Utility buttons like "Copy" should be hidden by default to maintain high data density but must be revealed on both hover *and* focus-visible to ensure keyboard users can discover and use them.
**Action:** Always add `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, and `onKeyDown` to non-native interactive elements. Use `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus-visible:opacity-100` for micro-interactions.

## 2025-05-16 - Robust Frontend Verification Workaround
**Learning:** Frontend verification in restricted environments often fails due to remote font-loading timeouts. Blocking font requests (`context.route("**/*.{ttf,woff,woff2,otf}", lambda route: route.abort())`) and injecting fallback system fonts (`* { font-family: sans-serif !important; }`) reliably bypasses these hangs. Additionally, mocking backend APIs using `page.route` prevents "Network Error" alerts and allows verification of data-dependent UI states.
**Action:** Use font-blocking and API mocking in Playwright scripts when remote assets or backend connectivity is unreliable.
