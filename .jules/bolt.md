## 2025-05-23 - [Optimization] O(M*N) to O(M) Scanner Loop
**Learning:** Avoid using 'find' on an array generated from a Map in a high-frequency loop. Creating the array via 'Array.from' is O(N) and the search is O(N), leading to quadratic complexity in the scanner.
**Action:** Always provide O(1) direct lookup methods in cache services to avoid linear searches in the main execution paths.
